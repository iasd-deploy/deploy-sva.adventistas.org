The GC Statistical Report indicates the first international volunteer deployment was in 1970 with 43 volunteers (records specified in ten year increments between 1960 through 1990). By September of 1996 the GC restructured the responsibilities and determined one Associate Secretary would process all of the volunteers. Elder Ronald Watts became its first director on September 1, 1996 through September 30, 1997. <p> On Nov 1, 1997, Elder Vernon B. Parmenter, GC Associate Secretary, became the Volunteer Director. They named the program the Adventist Volunteer Service (AVS) and the GC office was named the Adventist Volunteer Center (AVC). The AVS began trying to create its own database to streamline the application process. In 1999, Jonathan Brauer had a summer internship in Archives and Statistics. As a former Adventist Frontier Mission volunteer, he had a heart for volunteer missions and offered to assisted AVC in developing a database. When Jonathan returned to university in the autumn, he had a contract with AVC to continue working on the database. In 2000, the GC AVS database recorded 516 volunteers voted to serve by the GC Appointees Committee. Primarily, the website posted the calls or Service Request (SR). All forms were printed. Volunteers submitted their applications in paper/email/FAX format. Once applications were received by the GC AVC, basic information was entered into the website by GC AVC staff.</p>";

In 2006, Jonathan asked Eder Parmenter if Candace Renk could be a contract worker a few hours after work to assist him in developing the site. At the time, Candace was working in the Ellen G. White Estate. Prior to this, Candace was the NAD Volunteer Coordinator from 2001 through Dec 13, 2005. April of 2007 Candace was hired by Vernon B. Parmenter. The AVS website went public on May 24, 2007. Jonathan and Candace worked daily on the website for two years. In 2008, Ean Nugent was hired by GC ISS to maintain and develop the site. July 21, 2008 Elder Vernon B. Parmenter retired as Associate Secretary and AVS Director. <p> At the 2008 Annual Council, Homer Trecartin was voted as Associate Secretary and Director of the Adventist Volunteer Center. The brethren requested we have just one name: Adventist Volunteer Service (AVS). Elder Trecartin was voted to serve as GC Undersecretary on July 2 of the 2010 GC Session and John Hepburn Thomas was voted to serve as Homer’s replacement.</p>";

In September 1996 the GC reorganized the responsibilities and determined that an Associate Secretary would process the records of all volunteers. Pastor Ronald Watts became the department's first director from September 1, 1996, through September 30, 1997. <p> On November 1, 1997, the Pastor Vernon B. Parmenter, Associate Secretary of GC, became the Director of Volunteers. The program was named \"Adventist Volunteer Service\" (AVS), which translates to \"Adventist Volunteer Service\" \"and the General Conference office was named \" Adventist Volunteer Center \ \"(AVC), which is translated \" Adventist Volunteer Center \ \". AVS undertook the attempt to create its own database to automate the application process. In 1999, Johnathan Brauer dedicated a summer internship period in the area of ​​archives and statistics. As a former volunteer of the Adventist Frontier Mission, he had his heart turned to volunteer missions and volunteered to help AVC in the development of a database. When Johnathan returned to university in the fall, he had a contract as an AVC to continue working on the database. In the year 2000, the AVS CG database already had 516 volunteers voted by the CG naming committee for the service. The site posted the so-called, or Service Requests (SR), which translates to \ \"Service Requests \". All forms were printed. The volunteers presented their requests in paper, e-mail or fax. Once received the requests by the AVC, at the General Conference, basic information was posted on the AVS website by the AVC team. </ P> ";

Candace previously worked as a volunteer coordinator for the North American Division from 2001 until December 13, 2005. In April 2007, Candace was hired by Vernon B. Parmenter The Adventist Volunteer Service website was made public on May 24, 2007. Johnatan and Candace worked daily on the site for two years.In 2008 Ean Nugent was hired by the Information Systems to maintain and continue the development of the site. On July 21, 2008, Pastor Vernon B. Parmenter retired as Associate Secretary and Director of AVS. At the annual council, Homer Trecartin was voted as Associate Secretary and Director of the Adventist Volunteer Center. The brothers asked us to have only one name: Adventist Volunteer Service (AVS). Pastor Trecartín was chosen to serve as undersecretary of the CG at the General Conference session on July 2, 2010 and John Hepburn Thomas was chosen to serve in Homer's place. ";
